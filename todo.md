### TODO Tasks:

- [ ] IDEA! We could use SMTP to send emails so that the emails are signed correctly with DKIM 
- [ ] Update the APD contact form to email owner only, disable contact form on all subdomain accounts.
all subdomain accounts should redirect to login/home page, no access to public pages for security.
- [ ] Fix session DB errors on reload after session timeout.
